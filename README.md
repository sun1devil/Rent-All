## Using the Project

Open up the [project link](https://enigmatic-shore-55514.herokuapp.com/) and you should be able to try it out!

Users have to initialize code using npm init -y command in Terminal once they are in the folder with server.js file. Once initiated and JSON package created then the modules should be installed using the npm install command. 

Once all packages have been installed then the program can run using node server.js to run app through browser from a given port. This app will display a list of product out of which user will choose type and quantity, then the program will check if there is enough stock, if there is it will ouput a total and update the new quantity, if not it will prompt for something else. This projects handles user error when inputing values.
